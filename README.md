# The Depths
This is a 2D platformer game I am making with the Pygame module. 

# Movement
You will be able to walk, jump, fall, and attack. I plan to add rolling to the game. 

# Combat
Combat is pretty bare bones. You attack by pressing **A**. You can stun the skeletons by hitting them, however they can also stun you when they attack.

# Levels
There are tiles that move vertically, and I plan to add horiziontally moving tiles as well.
