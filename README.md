# The Depths
This is a 2D platformer game I am making with the Pygame module. In it's current state, it is more or less a rough prototype. I will be adding more to it, but for now, have fun with it and feel free to play around with the code.

# Movement
You will be able to walk, jump, fall, and attack. I plan to add rolling to the game. 

# Combat
Combat is pretty bare bones. You attack by pressing **A**. You can stun the skeletons by hitting them, however they can also stun you when they attack.

# Levels
There are tiles that move vertically, and I plan to add horiziontally moving tiles as well. 

# Assets
Here is where I found the spritesheets and other art: 
[Monsters](https://luizmelo.itch.io/monsters-creatures-fantasy)

[Knight](https://aamatniekss.itch.io/fantasy-knight-free-pixelart-animated-character)

[Enviroment](Will share link when I re-find them)

# Performance
I replaced the arrays I used with dictionaries/hashtables in order to increase performance. I made a seperate branch for that version, which you can find [here](https://github.com/GameAddict23/The_Depths/blob/performance). I will try to aim for performance, however given that this is python, I would not expect to keep a high standard.
